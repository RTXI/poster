###Poster

The most recent poster is from the 2015 SfN conference.  

Things to fix in future versions:  

 * Align 'Key features' header with block  
 * Add BU logo (because John relocated)  
 * *bold* all the URLs so they stand out more  
 * Align panel blocks on left and right edges so that they align with header bar  
 * Remove the "A1" at the end of the NIG logo ("A1" indicates the grant had to be resubmitted)
